# 3D Coding Journey 🚀🎨  
This repository documents my journey in learning how to create and manipulate 3D objects through code.  

## 📌 What's Inside?  
- 3D models (`.obj`, textures, sounds)  
- Java code for rendering and interacting with objects  
- Example projects showcasing different 3D designs  
- Notes & insights on 3D modeling  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- Java (using Java 3D)  
- `.obj` files for 3D models  
- `.jpg` textures for realism  
- `.mp3` sounds

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open Eclipse and import the project:
   - Go to **File** > **Import** > **General** > **Existing Projects into Workspace**.
   - Select the folder where the project was cloned/extracted.
3. The `lib/` folder contains all required libraries. No further setup needed for these.
4. Right-click on **TableLampMain.java** and select **Run As** > **Java Application**.

You should now see the 3D objects in action!
